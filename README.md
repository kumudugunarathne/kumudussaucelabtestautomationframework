Playwright-Based Automated Testing Framework

Overview

This project is an automated testing framework designed using Playwright, TestNG, and Java to perform end-to-end testing of a web application. The framework covers login validation, product filtering, cart verification, checkout workflow, API testing, visual regression, and performance testing.


Features

Dynamic Login Validation with multiple users.

Data-driven testing using JSON/CSV.

Product filtering and cart verification with dynamic product selection.

Multi-step checkout workflow with form validation and price calculation.

API Testing & UI-API Validation to verify data consistency.

Visual and Performance Testing for UI consistency and load time tracking.

Logging, Screenshots, and CI/CD integration for better reporting and test execution.


Test Scenarios

1️⃣ Dynamic Login Validation

Login with different users, including valid and locked accounts.

Validate error messages and detect slow-loading behavior.

Take screenshots on failure and log response times.


Requirements:

Data-driven testing (CSV/JSON as input).

Test fails if login takes more than 5 seconds.


Complex Product Filtering & Cart Verification

Sort products (Low to High Price) and validate sorting.

Add randomly selected products to the cart.

Verify cart prices and remove the most expensive item.



Requirements:

Dynamic product selection using randomization.

Assertions to validate sorting and cart updates.

JSON structured logs for cart data.



Multi-Step Checkout Workflow

Perform checkout with form validation.

Enter incorrect details (e.g., missing ZIP) and validate error messages.

Validate total price (including tax) before confirming the order.



Requirements:

Dynamic test data generation (JavaFaker).

Screenshot capture before confirming the order.

Ensure price calculations include tax/discounts.



API Testing & UI-API Validation

GET request to https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2.

Pick a random user and search for them on the UI.

Validate that API data matches UI data.


Requirements:

Playwright’s API testing features.

Compare API vs UI data.

Implement error handling for API failures.



Visual & Performance Testing

Perform visual regression testing on the product listing page.

Compare UI snapshots to detect layout changes.

Measure page load times (fail if >3 seconds).



Requirements:

Visual comparison with Playwright’s snapshot feature.

Performance metrics logging.

Retry mechanism for network issues.



Bonus Features:

Parallel execution for faster results.

Test Report Generation with structured logs and screenshots.
